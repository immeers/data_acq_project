## Topic
We want to understand airport arrival wait patterns by predicting future flight arrival times, the likelihood of delays and the time spent waiting in customs/passport control. We will be analyzing multiple different major airports in the United States and data from the past three years (2021-2024). To do so, we will use:

1. A Form API of wait times of international flights arriving into major US airports.

2. An API of historical flight data and length of flights.


Our motivation for pursuing this problem is our experiences with international travel. We understand the stress of making connections and wasting time walking around new airports during travel.

## Significance
This research problem is significant as oftentimes, flights take longer than expected or airports have unexpected delays. We want to be able to minimize wasted time in the airport and understand the likelihood of making a connecting flight based on historical flight data from a number of different airports. 


When flying internationally into the United States, this information can be very useful to help plan one's travel. Based on their predicted total flight time, travelers can select connecting flights that minimize wasted time waiting around in the airport and allow for adequate times between flights. This prediction information will also help travelers decide what time to book taxis or hire cars, or decide which airlines and airports to avoid at different times because of unreliability.
